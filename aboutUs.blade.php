                            & exercise movements to get you in the shape you want. Our workouts are 
                            all technique based, so that the student develops skills through repetition 
                            which develops muscle memory. We focus on four categories of fitness:

                            keys to our program is the balance between traditional techniques and modern 
                            training methods that are safe and effective.

                            I will look for the good in all people and make them feel worth while.

                            I will always be in a positive frame of mind convey this feeling to every person that I meet.

                            I will give so much time to the improvement of myself that I have no time to criticize others.

                            If I have nothing good to say about a person, I will say nothing.

                            I shall continually work at developing love, happiness and loyalty in my family and acknowledge that no other success can compensate failure in the home.

                            I shall develop myself to the maximum of my potential in all ways.

                            I will always remain loyal to my country and obey the laws of the land.

                            I will be as enthusiastic about the success of others as I am about my own.

                            I will forget about the mistakes of the past and press on to greater achievements in the future.

                            I will maintain an attitude of open-mindedness towards anotherâ€™s viewpoints while still holding fast to that I know to be true and honest.

                            I will maintain respect for those in authority and demonstrate this respect at all times.

                            I will become and remain highly goal oriented throughout my life.
